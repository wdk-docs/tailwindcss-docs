## <Heading hidden>概述</Heading>

建立在[modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize)之上，Preflight是一组用于顺风项目的基本样式，旨在消除跨浏览器的不一致性，并使您更容易在设计系统的约束下工作。

当你在CSS中包含`@tailwind base`时，Tailwind会自动注入这些样式:

```css
@tailwind base; /* Preflight will be injected here */

@tailwind components;

@tailwind utilities;
```

虽然Preflight中的大多数风格都是为了不被注意-它们只是让事情表现得更像你期望的那样-有些更固执己见，当你第一次遇到它们时可能会感到惊讶。

有关Preflight应用的所有样式的完整参考，请[参见样式表](https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^3/src/css/preflight.css).

## 默认页边距被删除

Preflight removes all of the default margins from elements like headings, blockquotes, paragraphs, etc.

```css
blockquote,
dl,
dd,
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6,
hr,
figure,
p,
pre {
  margin: 0;
}
```

This makes it harder to accidentally rely on margin values applied by the user-agent stylesheet that are not part of your spacing scale.

---

## 标题没有样式

All heading elements are completely unstyled by default, and have the same font-size and font-weight as normal text.

```css
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
  font-size: inherit;
  font-weight: inherit;
}
```

The reason for this is two-fold:

- **It helps you avoid accidentally deviating from your type scale**. By default, browsers assign sizes to headings that don't exist in Tailwind's default type scale, and aren't guaranteed to exist in your own type scale.
- **In UI development, headings should often be visually de-emphasized**. Making headings unstyled by default means any styling you apply to headings happens consciously and deliberately.

You can always add default header styles to your project by [adding your own base styles](/docs/adding-base-styles).

If you'd like to selectively introduce sensible default heading styles into article-style parts of a page, we recommend the [@tailwindcss/typography plugin](/docs/typography-plugin/).

## 列表没有样式

Ordered and unordered lists are unstyled by default, with no bullets/numbers and no margin or padding.

```css
ol,
ul {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

If you'd like to style a list, you can do so using the [list-style-type](/docs/list-style-type) and [list-style-position](/docs/list-style-position) utilities:

```html
<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</ul>
```

You can always add default list styles to your project by [adding your own base styles](/docs/adding-base-styles).

If you'd like to selectively introduce default list styles into article-style parts of a page, we recommend the [@tailwindcss/typography plugin](/docs/typography-plugin/).

### 可访问性的考虑

Unstyled lists are [not announced as lists by VoiceOver](https://unfetteredthoughts.net/2017/09/26/voiceover-and-list-style-type-none/). If your content is truly a list but you would like to keep it unstyled, [add a "list" role](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2019/01/12/lists-and-safari.html) to the element:

```html
<ul role="list">
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</ul>
```

## 图像是块级的

Images and other replaced elements (like `svg`, `video`, `canvas`, and others) are `display: block` by default.

```css
img,
svg,
video,
canvas,
audio,
iframe,
embed,
object {
  display: block;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

This helps to avoid unexpected alignment issues that you often run into using the browser default of `display: inline`.

If you ever need to make one of these elements `inline` instead of `block`, simply use the `inline` utility:

```html
<img class="inline" src="..." alt="...">
```

---

## 图像被限制为父宽度

Images and videos are constrained to the parent width in a way that preserves their intrinsic aspect ratio.

```css
img,
video {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

This prevents them from overflowing their containers and makes them responsive by default. If you ever need to override this behavior, use the `max-w-none` utility:

```html
<img class="max-w-none" src="..." alt="...">
```

---

## 边框样式是全局重置的

In order to make it easy to add a border by simply adding the `border` class, Tailwind overrides the default border styles for all elements with the following rules:

```css
*,
::before,
::after {
  border-width: 0;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: theme('borderColor.DEFAULT', currentColor);
}
```

Since the `border` class only sets the `border-width` property, this reset ensures that adding that class always adds a solid 1px border using your configured default border color.

This can cause some unexpected results when integrating certain third-party libraries, like [Google maps](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/484) for example.

When you run into situations like this, you can work around them by overriding the Preflight styles with your own custom CSS:

```css
.google-map * {
  border-style: none;
}
```

## 扩展 Preflight

If you'd like to add your own base styles on top of Preflight, simply add them to your CSS using the `@layer base` directive:

```css
@tailwind base;

@layer base {
  h1 {
    @apply text-2xl;
  }
  h2 {
    @apply text-xl;
  }
  h3 {
    @apply text-lg;
  }
  a {
    @apply text-blue-600 underline;
  }
}

@tailwind components;

@tailwind utilities;
```

Learn more in the [adding base styles documentation](/docs/adding-base-styles).

## 禁用 Preflight

If you'd like to completely disable Preflight — perhaps because you're integrating Tailwind into an existing project or because you'd like to provide your own base styles — all you need to do is set `preflight` to `false` in the `corePlugins` section of your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```diff-js {{ filename: 'tailwind.config.js' }}
  module.exports = {
+   corePlugins: {
+     preflight: false,
+   }
  }
```

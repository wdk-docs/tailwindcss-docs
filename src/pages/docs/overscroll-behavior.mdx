## 基本用法

### 防止父级滚动过度

使用`overscroll-contain`来防止目标区域的滚动触发父元素中的滚动，但在支持该操作系统的操作系统中，当滚动超过容器的末端时保留`弹跳`效果。

```html {{ example: { p: 'none' } }}
<div class="mx-4 overscroll-contain overflow-auto h-48 bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 shadow-xl p-8 space-y-4 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-400 text-sm sm:text-base leading-6 sm:leading-7">
  <p>Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.</p>
  <p>Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior.</p>
  <p>Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure, we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down, opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better?</p>
</div>
```

```html
<div class="**overscroll-contain** ...">Well, let me tell you something, ...</div>
```

### 防止超滚动弹跳

Use `overscroll-none` to prevent scrolling in the target area from triggering scrolling in the parent element, and also prevent "bounce" effects when scrolling past the end of the container.

```html {{ example: { p: 'none' } }}
<div class="mx-4 overscroll-none overflow-auto h-48 bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 shadow-xl p-8 space-y-4 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-400 text-sm sm:text-base leading-6 sm:leading-7">
  <p>Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.</p>
  <p>Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior.</p>

</div>
```

```html
<div class="**overscroll-none** ...">Well, let me tell you something, ...</div>
```

### 使用默认的超滚动行为

Use `overscroll-auto` to make it possible for the user to continue scrolling a parent scroll area when they reach the boundary of the primary scroll area.

```html {{ example: { p: 'none' } }}
<div class="mx-4 overscroll-auto overflow-auto h-48 bg-white dark:bg-slate-800 shadow-xl p-8 space-y-4 text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-400 text-sm sm:text-base leading-6 sm:leading-7">

```

## 基本用法

### Setting the text alignment

Control the text alignment of an element using the `text-left`, `text-center`, `text-right`, and `text-justify` utilities.

```html {{ example: { p: 'none' } }}
<div class="px-4 sm:px-0">
  <div class="mx-auto max-w-xl bg-white shadow-xl p-8 text-slate-700 text-sm leading-6 sm:text-base sm:leading-7 dark:bg-slate-800 dark:text-slate-400">
    <p class="text-left">
      So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
```
